    <p>If you use EnCAB in a publication, please add the bibliographical
      information to the <a href="../bibliography/EnCAB_bib.html">appropriate
        page</a> on the GitHub Pages site; if you prefer, you can also send the
      reference (and, if possible, a PDF of the publication) to the project
      email address (webmaster.encab[at]gmail{.}com). Note, however, that EnCAB
      has no permanent curator, so it may be a while before your data is

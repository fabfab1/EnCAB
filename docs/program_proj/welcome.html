    <h4><a>What is EnCAB?</a></h4>
    <p>EnCAB (Energetic Calculator for Ancient Buildings; see <a href="project.html">project
        page</a> for more info on the project itself) is an <a href="../cite/cite.html">online
        publication</a> of the Energetic Calculator for Ancient Buildings, a
      tool used to measure the energy required in pre-industrial construction
      projects. The calculator is based on a series of <a href="../algorithms_indices/algorithms_index.html">interactive
        algorithms</a> which quantify the energy required for very specific
      steps in the construction process. These steps are perhaps best defined
      through a <em>chaîne opératoire</em>, which allows scholars to chart the
      individual steps in a construction project.</p>
    <p>EnCAB goes far beyond a mere collection of algorithms, however. First,
      there is a <a href="../critique/critique.html">critical
        discussion</a> of the <a href="../source_type/source_type_index.html">sources</a>
      used: ethnographic, experimental or textual. Each <a href="../algorithms_indices/algorithms_index.html">algorithm</a>
      is further correlated in a number of ways, including <a href="../source_geography/source_geography_index.html">geographical</a>
      and <a href="../source_chronology/source_chronology_index.html">chronological</a>
      scope or the <a href="../position_in_process/position_in_process_index.html">position
        in the construction</a> process. Common <a href="../alg_chains/alg_chains.html">chains
        of algorithms</a> are proposed in order to aid first time users
      understand how the <em>chaîne opératoire </em>and the algorithms are
      best used in tandem.</p>
    <p>EnCAB is an Open Source project, and as such will hopefully serve as a
      growing hub for research in energetics and construction.</p>
    <h4><a>EnCAB -- Origins</a></h4>
    <p>EnCAB is a development of a research project examining the construction
      of a 3rd millennium palace at Tell Mozan, ancient Urkesh (see <a href="../bibliography/bibliography.html">Buccellati
        2016</a>). This study examined the energetic cost of a single building
      -- at the conclusion of that project the applicability of algorithms
      across a spectrum of structures was evident, and the idea of a digital
      humanities publication focused on algorithms was born.</p>
    <h4><a>How to Use EnCAB</a></h4>
    <p>In order to use EnCAB, one needs the volumetric calculations for an
      ancient construction as well as a hypothesis as to the steps of
      construction which were followed. The algorithms in EnCAB can then be used
      to calculate the energy needed for the construction.</p>
    <h4><a>After the Initial Calculation<br>
      </a></h4>
    <p>Once that calculation has been made one can use the algorithms to explore
      diverse questions related to the construction, primarily in two ways:
      alternatives and comparisons. Algorithms can be used to examine 'what
      if...' scenarios, such as considering the difference in energy costs if a
      courtyard had been paved in sundried bricks instead of flagstones.
      Comparisons can be made to other similar structures from the same
      settlement, similar settlements or even cross-cultural comparisons. A <a

        href="../bibliography/EnCAB_bib.html">list
        of publications</a> using EnCAB algorithms is available to aid scholars
      looking for comparative material.</p>

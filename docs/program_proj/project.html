    </header>
    <h4><a>Project Goals<br>
      </a></h4>
    <p>EnCAB is designed as a digital publication based on a collection of
      algorithms drawn from diverse sources and applicable to construction
      projects in pre-industrial societies. The goal is to provide a single
      resource where algorithms are collected, made available with interactive
      fields, categorized and with a discussion of the categories, and a
      critique of the use of such algorithms. Thus EnCAB makes the algorithms
      and the assumptions used to estimate energetic cost explicit, reproducible
      and with a bibliographic status to which scholars can refer.</p>
    <p>As a digital publication, EnCAB is <a href="../cite/cite.html">citeable</a>
      and has its own DOI, and references any information drawn from external
      sources in a complete <a href="../bibliography/bibliography.html">bibliography</a>.
      The HTML pages and algorithms have been written by specific <a href="../authors/authors_index.html">authors</a>,
      to whom credit is given. The algorithms used by EnCAB are drawn from a
      wide variety of sources and chronological contexts, and have been adapted
      to a standard format in order to provide users with interactive fields.
      This adaptation of the algorithms, their classification and descriptions
      as well as their inclusion in <a href="../alg_chains/alg_chains.html">chains</a>
      have all been carried out by the authors mentioned above, and form the
      core of the publication. The interactive algorithms can be used by
      scholars working with the built environment in order to calculate
      energetic and material costs of specific tasks. These algorithms should be
      used with a full understanding of the <a href="../critique/critique.html">possible
        faults</a> in the methodology, and this should be made clear in any
      derivative works.</p>
    <p>EnCAB is of great utility because of its ability to compare diverse
      structures across a wide range of contexts. These comparisons can be
      divided into three categories: local, regional and inter-cultural. On the
      local level, EnCAB could be used to compare contemporary individual
      buildings within a category, for example houses, or could be used to
      examine differences between buildings of the same type across time, for
      example changes in houses from one period to another. Regional studies
      could focus on the same types of comparisons as on the local level,
      perhaps adding the difference in quantity of work between two types at
      different sites: how much more is invested in palaces when compared to
      houses at site A, and does that proportion remain the same across the
      sites of the region? Finally, inter-cultural comparisons could ask the
      same types of questions but seeking examples from different cultural
      contexts, examining how much energy and materials were expended in
      Mesopotamia on temples when compared to Elamite or Greek temples.</p>
    <p>EnCAB allows scholars to define not only the details of construction, but
      use that data to explore broader questions, such as monumentality &amp;
      prestige, the relative value of materials and the added value of traded
      goods, investment across diverse types of public construction
      (palace/temple vs. city wall/canal), or the relative difference in types
      of construction across cultural, geographic or chronological boundaries.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h4><a>What EnCAB is <i>not</i><br>
      </a></h4>
    <p>EnCAB is by no means the only way to describe architecture. Architecture
      is an extremely complex and rich resource for scholars studying the past,
      and the study of the effort required in construction is merely one way to
      understand it. Energetics can be of particular use when comparing
      buildings, as the same algorithms can be used to analyze diverse buildings
      and the differences in those answers can lead scholars to conclusions
      about a wide range of cultural aspects.</p>
    <h4><a>Supporting descriptions<br>
      </a></h4>
    <p>While the algorithms build the core of EnCAB, there is a great number of
      descriptive pages linked to the six categories into which the algorithms
      are classified:<br>
    </p>
    <p>The index of <u>material categories</u> can be found <a href="material/material_index.html">here</a>.<br>
      The index of <u>steps in the process</u> can be found <a href="position_in_process/position_in_process_index.html">here</a>.<br>
      The index of <u>source chronology</u> categories can be found <a href="source_chronology/source_chronology_index.html">here</a>.<br>
      The index of <u>source geography</u> can be found <a href="source_geography/source_geography_index.html">here</a>.<br>
      The index of <u>source types</u> can be found <a href="source_type/source_type_index.html">here</a>.<br>
      The index of <u>algorithm types</u> can be found <a href="algorithm_type/algorithm_type_index.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p> In addition to the categories, there are also pages describing the units
      used in the algorithms and a complete bibliography of the publications
      used. </p>
    <p>The index of <u>units used</u> can be found <a href="units/units_index.html">here</a>.<br>
      The <u>bibliography</u> can be found <a href="../bibliography/bibliography.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Further individual pages give additional information on EnCAB, such as
      this page or the <a href="../authors/authors_index.html">author pages</a>.</p>
    <h4><a>Project -- Algorithms and Pages</a></h4>
    <p>A total of 30 algorithms are currently in EnCAB (as of July 1, 2018),
      along with 71 unique HTML files and 21 references in the bibliography. The
      Python 3.6 scripts and associated files run to a total of 565 lines of
      code.</p>
    <h4><a>Project -- Future Plans<br>
      </a></h4>
    <p>While EnCAB, as presented here, is a finished publication (one that will
      hopefully will be expanded by other <a href="../contribute/contribute.html">contributors</a>)
      there is still quite a bit of work to be done; the generation of new
      algorithms to fill gaps in the chains and to create more overlap is
      perhaps the most important. Future research would also include a range of
      case studies showing how algorithms can aid in intra- and inter-cultural
      comparative studies.</p>

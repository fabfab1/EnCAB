<h2 id="hello--welcome">Hello &amp; welcome!</h2>

<p>Hi! We’re Mozilla, a global non-profit fueling the movement for 
Internet health. Our mission is to ensure the Internet is a global 
public resource, open and accessible to all. We work for an Internet 
that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own 
experience and are empowered, safe and independent.</p>

<p>A healthy Internet helps people live and learn online. It includes 
everyone in its possibilities. It belongs to the people and resists 
being closed off or broken apart. On a healthy Internet, we are all free
 to share and benefit from one another’s innovative, new ideas because 
of a culture of inclusivity, openness, and care. We work together there 
to fight harassment, engage critically with media, and help ourselves 
and our communities to maintain control of our own online lives.</p>

<p>Some big ideas connected to <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/">Internet health</a> include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Online Privacy &amp; Security:</strong> People understand
 and can meaningfully control how their data is collected and used 
online, and trust that it’s safe. In parallel, companies and governments
 work to protect our data and enhance our ownership over our digital 
identities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Open Innovation:</strong> Open is the default: open 
source and open standards continue to be at the heart of the Internet, 
and influence organizations and industries products, policies and 
practices. As a result, entrepreneurs and everyday Internet users can 
create, innovate and compete online without asking permission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Decentralization:</strong> The technologies and platforms
 people use every day are interoperable and based on open standards. 
People expect and demand systems that allow seamless flow and transfer 
of information and content.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Digital Inclusion:</strong> People everywhere can access 
and have the opportunity to participate in building the entire Internet.
 Subsequently, everyone on the Internet has the opportunity to access 
and shape our digital world. The Internet reflects the diversity of the 
people who use it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Web Literacy:</strong> People have the skills to read, 
write and participate in the digital world. Together, these informed 
digital citizens move beyond just consuming content, to creating, 
shaping and defending the web.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Think of Internet health and these big ideas as the “what” and “why” 
of what we do. Our commitment to these core values drives our work.</p>

<p>Open leadership is the “how” of our work. It’s how we accomplish our 
work in communities, organizations, and projects. open leadership 
encompases the processes and resources we use to support Internet health
 for everyone’s benefit.</p>

<p>Open leaders “work open.” They work collaboratively, sharing the 
ownership of  ideas, resources, and outcomes with contributors, while 
building powerful, diverse communities to support and direct projects 
and organizations. They also set the conditions for others to do the 
same, ensuring accountability, equity, and transparency in a project and
 its community.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of how Open Leaders work on the “what” and “why” of their projects and organizations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> began its life as an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quKdaqlR_9w">open-source project</a> to create a web browser that would break corporate monopolies over the web.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://voice.mozilla.org/">Common Voice</a> is Mozilla’s initiative to crowdsource a large, public dataset of human voices for use in <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/berlin/en/people/kelly-davis-common-voice-project/">open speech technology</a>.
 By working in the open, Mozilla was able to reach a much broader group 
of contributors, partners, and users. Each group helped us build and 
guide Common Voice along the way. Making Common Voice successful largely
 meant facilitating the collaboration between these groups who, like us,
 want to see speech technology more open and accessible to all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network</a> (MDN) created a <a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data">repository</a>
 to collect and structure browser compatibility information to provide 
the community with open data to build cross-browser tools and websites. 
This was immensely successful, attracting a diverse group of dedicated 
contributors to help migrate data into the repo, and making it a place 
where a new community shares knowledge about browser compatibility.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <a href="https://medium.com/read-write-participate/mozilla-italia-l10n-guide-e6f6d36b45bb">The Mozilla Italia l10n Guide</a>, Sara Todaro uses <a href="https://github.com/kitsunenosaraT/Mozilla-Italia-l10n-guide/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contributing Guidelines</a> to outline how others can participate in the project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <a href="https://uoftcoders.github.io/">UofT coders</a>, their leadership team uses the <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/bring-on-contributors-using-personas-and-pathways/">personas and pathways</a> exercise to identify potential blockers to participation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <a href="https://themethodpodcast.com/">The Method Podcast</a>, April Clyburne-Sherin includes many different ways to submit audio to make participation as easy as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://opensnp.org/">openSNP</a> allows customers of 
direct-to-customer genetic tests to publish their test results, find 
others with similar genetic variations, learn more about their results 
by getting the latest primary literature on their variations, and help 
scientists find new associations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jos de Block, founder of <a href="http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Case_Examples_of_Successful_Journeys#Buurtzorg">Buurtzorg</a>
 in the Netherlands, created an innovative neighborhood nursing company 
that shares its business model freely with competitors to improve elder 
care for all (Laloux, 2016).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nora Dashwood, COO of <a href="https://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/an-everyone-culture-employee-training-development.html">the Decurion Corporation</a>,
 facilitates an internal, communal governance process that allows all 
employees to contribute insights to decision-making and participates in 
culture of constant feedback in which any employee can give another 
feedback safely, regardless of relative position (Kegan &amp; Lahey, 
2015).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jim Whitehurst, CEO of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/explore/the-open-organization-book">RedHat</a>,
 oversees an “inclusive” decision-making process that provides employees
 with the opportunity to weigh in on decisions that affect them and to 
get all the information they need to address their concerns before 
giving feedback. (Whitehurst, 2014).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This framework will help you understand, adapt, and use open 
leadership practices to further your work in the Internet health 
movement and beyond.</p>

<p>Together, we can use the principles and practices of open leadership 
to build a healthy Internet reflective of the society we want to see in 
the world. We are glad to be doing this work alongside you. Thank your 
for leadership and for sharing your open journey with us!</p>

<h2 id="who-and-what-is-this-framework-for">Who and what is this framework for?</h2>

<p>This framework is for anyone who shares our passion for openness, 
working open, and open leadership. It is meant for readers from both 
technical and non-technical backgrounds who want to use open leadership 
as a means to improve their work, help their communities, and further 
their personal and professional growth.</p>

<p>The aim of the framework is to establish an adaptable set of open 
leadership principles, practices, and skills that people can use for 
personal and professional development as part of an open community or 
project. More practical resources built from this framework -  like 
guides, curriculum, programming, and events - will come later.</p>

<p>The framework is meant to be a foundation for later work, and, as 
such, it is not meant to be a practical guide or curriculum just yet. 
Moreover, the framework itself will likely evolve over time as we 
discover more use cases for it in our work and in our wider community’s 
work to share open practices. While it is in some ways limiting to start
 with any particular set of principles and practices, we believe it’s 
important to share what we know and make this contribution to ongoing 
conversations about working open and open leadership in the world.</p>

<p>To put it another way: This framework is the first step of a larger, 
on-going project to develop curriculum, events, trainings, and online 
resouces like an open leadership map that will help people locate 
themselves and then move ahead in their open leadership journeys.</p>

<p>If you’re curious about the kinds of use cases we evision and plan for the framework, you can review and test these prototypes:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-open">What is open?</h2>

<p>Openness includes deals and practices that any kind of community, project, or organization can practice.</p>

<p>These three principles help define openness:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Understanding:</strong> You make the work accessible and clear.</li>
  <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> You make the work easy to adapt, reproduce, and spread.</li>
  <li><strong>Participation &amp; inclusion:</strong> You build shared 
ownership and agency with contributors through accountability, equity, 
and transparency to make the work inviting, relevant,  safe, and 
sustainable for all.</li>
</ul>

<p>We believe that it is important to work intentionally and mindfully towards <strong><em>Understanding</em></strong>. Here, <strong>understanding</strong>
 means not only being accessible, but also being transparent in how a 
community or project is structured, how it makes decisions and does it 
work, and how it shares that work and news about it with contributors 
and users.</p>

<p>We beieve that it is important to ensure the <strong>sharing</strong>
 of an open community or project. The value of openness comes in large 
part from how it empowers others to adapt and continue the work they 
contrbiuted to for their own uses and the uses of their networks and 
communities outside any original project.</p>

<p>We believe that any efforts a community. leader, or project makes 
towards inclusion must include authentic, significant, and valuable 
opportunities for participation, contribution and leadership. To make 
that belief an explicit part of the framework and its design, we paired <strong>participation &amp; inclusion</strong>.</p>

<p>At its core, being “open” is about structuring any project or 
organization, technical or not, to invite the widest possible diversity 
of contributors from outside your organization’s boundaries. Who are 
contributors? People who give time, expertise, and labor to a project. A
 project that supports diverse contributors creates an inclusive 
community of people working together because of the interests and 
passions they share. That community includes new “insiders” who may have
 once felt like they were “outsiders” - people outside of a community, 
organization, or project’s notional boundaries who join a project 
because of shared expertise, interests, and passions.</p>

<p>Some projects need specific skill sets and define more narrow 
contribution pathways. There’s a tension in such projects between 
aspirations of inclusivity and the details of the project. Open leaders 
strive to collaborate with their communities to imagine and make 
concrete as many authentic, valuable opportunities as possible for 
potential participants.</p>

<p>Open projects also return value to their contributors to compensate 
them somehow for their work. Open practices like shared decision-making,
 conflict-resolution, and mentorship help people feel welcome, safe, and
 inspired.</p>

<p>Furthermore, when a project is fully open it invites contributions 
from anyone. Open projects share their processes, workflows, and 
outcomes through accessible platforms and open licensing. This kind of 
sharing is what we traditionally mean when we talk about an open 
project. It maximizes impact by clearing some obstacles, like cost, out 
of your users’ way. It also encourages and incentivizes adoption by 
letting users change and build off your work to better suit their needs,
 amplifying the usefulness and reach of your project through new and 
unexpected user-generated outcomes.</p>

<p>Leads and contributors can also open projects that are not only or 
essentially technical in nature. Projects that serve the public good 
through educational programming or other forms of activism can be open, 
as well.</p>

<p>The altruism and idealism of openness connect people to one another 
through projects and organizations that invite them to build together 
for social good.</p>

<p>However, not every open project or organization is fully open. 
Requiring a project or organization to open everything all the time 
would be a high barrier to entry. The Open Leadership Framework (shared 
below)  is meant to help you think intentionally and strategically about
 when, how, and why to work open according to the needs of your 
contributors and community, whether they’re employees or volunteers, and
 whether you’re part of a fully open, community-serving social 
enterprise, non-profit, or research project or something else, like a 
for-profit company. The big idea is to discover how you can lead your 
project or organization to be more open, inclusive, and effective in 
making a difference in your contributors’ lives and in the world through
 increasingly open practices. Our intent is to help you, your community,
 and your project be “open by design,” not only “open by default.”</p>

<h2 id="what-is-open-leadership">What is open leadership?</h2>

<p><strong><em>We think of Open Leadership as a set of principles, 
practices, and skills people can use to mobilize their communities to 
solve shared problems and achieve shared goals.</em></strong> The 
leadership part comes from mobilizing communities to solve problems and 
achieve goals. What makes open leadership “open,” however, is the way 
that it shares roles and responsibilities for decision-making, 
content-creation, and information-sharing across a project or community.
 Open leaders develop the systems and workflows that make their projects
 successful with the input and participation of volunteer contributors 
and users who draw value from being able to freely access, adapt, and 
change those projects for their own needs and the needs of their 
communities.</p>

<p>Open Leaders <strong>design</strong>, <strong>build</strong>, and <strong>empower</strong>
 contribution pathways, projects and organizations to promote openness 
and social good throughout their work and across society. They <strong>design</strong>, <strong>build</strong>, and <strong>empower</strong> for <strong>understanding</strong>, <strong>sharing</strong>, and <strong>participation and inclusion</strong>, the key principles of openness.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Design:</strong> You plan projects for contributors and users’ specific needs and capacities.</li>
  <li><strong>Build:</strong> You create systems and solutions that maximize a project’s clarity, usability, and inclusiveness.</li>
  <li><strong>Empower:</strong> You help contributors own the work through transparency, accountability, and shared decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<p>The skills, competencies, and outcomes of open leadership can help 
you mobilize your community, think strategically about how to advance 
its work through open practices, and develop your own personal 
leadership style that inspires contribution and models openness.</p>

<p>The benefits of open leadership include improving the quality of your
 work, increasing its efficiency and innovation, lowering its costs, and
 increasing its discoverability and reach in the world (Klepel, 2017). 
The Hive Research Lab affirms that working open leads to improved 
projects, greater efficiency, increased discoverability, and a stronger 
public commons (Santo, Ching, Peppler &amp; Hoadley, 2014).</p>

<p>These goals and their strategic benefits might look slightly different across contexts.</p>

<p>For example, different types of organizations might realize these benefits slightly differently.</p>

<p><img src="why-open-table.png" alt="A table showing the benefits of openness to for-profit, non-profit, advocacy-based, and public sector organizations concerning improved quality, improved efficiency, and improved reach"></p>

<p>Across contexts, open leadership is facilitative and service-oriented
 in that it helps communities of contributors and users create relevant,
 functional solutions to personally and collectively meaningful problems
 through shared accountability, agency, decision-making, ownership, and 
responsibility.</p>

<p>Of course, these benefits come with costs. It takes time and effort 
to open a closed project, to resolve conflicts, and to make decisions 
that stay true to openness. It takes time to design, test, and improve 
systems. There aren’t shortcuts to accountability, equity, and 
transparency. Being open often means being messy. Sometimes it feels 
like a project is getting worse - like there are more issues and 
tensions to resolve than ever - before it gets better. Openness uncovers
 what your project and its community need to work on in terms of 
creating authentic, shared ownership of the work. You can only realize 
the benefits of this approach through a sustained commitment to a 
project, its people, and open principles.</p>

<p>Open leaders follow these principles and use these practices and 
skills to ensure that a project and its contributors will succeed 
without them. They share accountability, authority, and power with their
 communities to focus relentlessly on users’ needs and how contributors 
can best meet them.</p>

<p>Agency, equity, and ownership of the work and its outcomes are 
distributed and decentralized in open projects to maximize their reach, 
relevance, and sustainability.</p>

<p>Right now, you may be working on a closed project that you’d like to 
open, or you might be working on a project that practices a kind of 
constant, “shout it from the rooftops” kind of open  (Thompson, 2011). 
At any point in your open leadership journey, this guide and the Open 
Leadership Framework are meant to help you reflect on your work, share 
what you do with others, and take your next step to grow as a leader.</p>

<p>Shortly, we’ll take a closer look at how <strong>designing</strong>, <strong>building</strong>, and <strong>empowering</strong> for <strong>understanding</strong>, <strong>sharing</strong>, and <strong>participation &amp; inclusion</strong> break down into specific skills and competencies below.</p>

<h2 id="open-leadership-is-not">Open leadership is not…</h2>

<p>Let’s pause for a moment and clear up a few common misconceptions 
about open leadership before we look at the Open Leadership Framework.</p>

<p>Open Leadership is not (Thompson, 2011):</p>

<ul>
  <li>A way to get free labor.</li>
  <li>A way to avoid process or structure.</li>
  <li>A way to hit your deadline faster.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, open leadership requires you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clearly communicate the goals of your project and the value of working on your project.</li>
  <li>Create robust, transparent systems for content development, governance, and information-sharing.</li>
  <li>Test and revise your work until it meets your community’s needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>It takes rigor to practice open leadership and your contributors and 
communities will hold you accountable for maintaining the openness of 
your shared work.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-open-leadership-different">How is open leadership different?</h2>

<p>In many ways, open leadership is like other forms of good or 
effective leadership. The best leaders find ways to empower people 
through work, recognition, and experiences that speak to individual and 
collective needs in fulfilling ways.</p>

<p>However, open leaders hold themselves accountable to a wider audience
 of contributors and users than traditional leaders do. They:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Locate agency, ownership, and recognition within their communities
 of contributors and users, not only within themselves. Their power is 
the ability to give away power. They share authority and 
decision-making, delegate responsibilities, and mentor community members
 to the point of their own obsolescence.</li>
  <li>Help change systems in response to contributors and users’ needs. 
Rather than always follow a single approach, they commit to a larger, 
encompassing, meta-framework that ensures accountability and 
transparency in whatever systems they create, adopt, or adapt with their
 communities.</li>
  <li>Carry a responsibility to share governance, content-creation, and 
information equitably between themselves and contributors who may be 
volunteers, rather than staffers, from a variety of professional and 
local contexts.</li>
  <li>Open their projects to the widest possible diversity of 
contributors which requires especially mindful matchmaking, mentoring, 
and community management.</li>
  <li>Depend on others to help lead their communities asynchronously, across cultures, geographies, and time zones.</li>
  <li>Consciously choose to follow the principles, practices, and skills
 of working open and open leadership as their particular pathway to 
good, effective, or even great leadership. They design, build, and 
empower their projects and communities for understanding, sharing, and 
participation and inclusion. They use these principles and practices to 
hold themselves accountable to their contributors and users’ feedback 
and needs in dynamic, transparent ways.</li>
</ul>

<p>Open leaders are experts in helping each project meet its community’s
 needs. They help others see openness as the abundant presence of the 
systems and people they need to succeed.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-individuals-benefit-from-open-leadership">How do individuals benefit from open leadership?</h2>

<p>Contributing to an open community or project can be an altruistic 
act, but such contributions also carry benefit for the individual.</p>

<p>Open leaders empower others to become open leaders in their own 
right. By inviting others to collaborate, open leaders continue their 
own personal and professional leadership development and find trusted 
contributors to whom they can delegate work and offer mentorship for 
project sustainability and maintenance and for the overall health of the
 open movement.</p>

<p>Contributors can benefit from the same kind of intrinsic personal and
 professional development as they assume more responsibility in a 
project and receive mentorship from other leaders in their project 
communities. They can also draw other kinds of extrinsic value from a 
project such as social capital within their professional networks, a 
forkable version of a project they can use in their own lives or within 
their networks, and any other specific benefits offered by a project or 
its community.</p>

<p>Open leaders work to make the value exchanges between themselves, 
their projects, and their contributors transparent and mutually and 
equitably beneficial.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-open-leadership-benefit-the-user">How does open leadership benefit the user?</h2>

<p>Just as the structure of an open project or community is meant to 
empower its contributors, the outcome or product of an open project is 
meant to empower its users. Users should be able to use, study, share, 
and adapt an open project just as contributors do. Users should have 
agency and ownership over the deliverable of an open project for their 
own uses. This ability to interact with the outcome of an open project 
helps invite users to become contributors, leaders, and innovators in 
their own rights as they adapt and localize products for their own needs
 and the needs of their communities.</p>

<p>Everything an open leader does is meant to help contributors 
understand their users’ needs and take them into account during each 
step of a project. From this perspective, leaders and contributors work 
together to design and build projects that empower users and create 
social good.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of open leadership is to develop communities of 
practice full of leaders and contributors who educate and empower users 
with open alternatives to black-box products and products, services, and
 technologies that exploit them. It’s not that an open project can’t be 
profitable or collect data, it’s that open projects have clear and 
equitable value exchanges between their creators and users. Open leaders
 hold themselves accountable for transparency in the relationships 
between projects, their contributors, and their users in ways that 
closed, strictly for-profit organizations and leaders do not.</p>

<p>That commitment to making sure that users understand and benefit from
 a clear and balanced value exchange differentiates open leadership from
 other forms of good or effective leadership.</p>

<h2 id="the-open-leadership-framework">The Open Leadership Framework</h2>

<p>Open leadership is a set of practices and skills people can use to 
mobilize their communities to solve shared problems and achieve shared 
goals.</p>

<p>To put it another way, open leaders design and build projects that empower people to collaborate within inclusive communities.</p>

<p>Open leaders are guided by open <strong>principles</strong>. They strive for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Understanding:</strong> They make the work accessible and clear.</li>
  <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> They make the work easy to adapt, reproduce, and spread.</li>
  <li><strong>Participation &amp; inclusion:</strong> They make the work inviting, relevant, and safe for all.</li>
</ul>

<p>To apply these principles, open leaders take these <strong>practices</strong>. They:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Design:</strong> They make contextual, deliberate decisions about how and when to be open.</li>
  <li><strong>Build:</strong> They create structures, and systems that ensure clarity and process-based management.</li>
  <li><strong>Empower:</strong> They model personal leadership skills that sustain them and their contributors.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, open leaders and their communities, organizations, and 
projects work towards these objectives. They help their communities, 
organizations, and projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improve the efficiency, quality, and relevance of their work.</li>
  <li>Discover new, innovative solutions that make sense to them.</li>
  <li>Increase the discoverability, reach, lifespan and usefulness of their work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not every community, organization, or project works towards all of 
those objectives, principles, or actions at once. Instead, open leaders 
work with their contributors - the people who give their time, talent, 
and expertise to a project - to focus on the elements that will help 
them achieve shared goals. For example, a local project might first work
 to <strong>improve efficiency</strong>, <strong>quality</strong>, and <strong>relevance</strong>. Later, it might share more to <strong>increase the discoverability</strong>, <strong>reach</strong>, <strong>lifespan</strong> and <strong>usefulness</strong> of its work. Then another community could <strong><em>discover new</em></strong>, <strong>innovative solutions</strong> localized for them.</p>

<p>This Open Leadership Framework suggests areas of focus you can 
concentrate on during your open leadership journey to achieve these 
goals. <strong>To use the framework, consider your objective(s) and look
 at the principles, actions, and embedded skills that might best help 
you reach your goals.</strong></p>

<p><img src="olf-framework-bw.png" alt="A table or framework showing the embedded skills that align with each principle and action of open leadership"></p>

<p>We’ll dive into each section of the framework below.</p>

<p>A quick note: we’ve borrowed a list of <a href="https://medium.com/mozilla-open-innovation/a-framework-of-open-practices-9a17fe1645a3">6 “community interactions”</a>
 from Mozilla’s Open Innovation Strategy Team and grouped them with 
particular practices below. Each type of interaction carries its own 
range of activities. For example, “soliciting ideas” might amount to 
crowdsourcing ideas from a community of users without offering much 
value in return, or it might mean bringing in a group of users who first
 contribute their ideas and then get invited to work on them as credited
 developers during a “creating together” interaction later in the same 
project. Open leaders choose these interaction types strategically for 
particular projects and stages of projects, but they also strategically 
decide on and define levels of interaction within each type.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>These are the strategic prompts open leaders use to set goals and 
determine the levels of openness their projects will have in terms of 
operations and interactions with their communities. This is how Open 
Leaders decide what to share, how to share it, and why to share it that 
way. Open leaders use the skills and practices of <strong>design</strong> to boost the quality of their work and extend its reach.</p>

<p><img src="olf-design.png" alt="This organizer shows the actions and embedded skills of Design"></p>

<p>When you design, you remain open to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Questioning when, how, and why you bring openness to each part of 
your project or organization in an intentional, strategic way that 
informs how you <strong>build</strong> things and <strong>empower</strong> people for maximum impact.</li>
  <li>Evaluating the most inclusive, efficient levels of openness for 
content development, governance (or decision-making), and 
information-sharing for your project or organization to reach as many 
people as possible with the highest quality work you have to share.</li>
  <li>Determining how best to interact with contributors and community 
members to fuel participation and innovation without exploiting others 
under cover of openness (Klepel, 2017).</li>
</ul>

<p>As you develop your open leadership practice, you should begin to think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to align the management practices of <strong>build</strong> with the strategic decisions you make.</li>
  <li>How to develop the personal leadership skills from <strong>empower</strong> that can help you share ownership of strategic decisions with contributors.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the concrete principles, skills, and competencies Open 
Leaders need to structure and manage projects and communities. This is 
how Open Leaders define a project and establish its guidelines and 
workflow.</p>

<p><img src="olf-build.png" alt="This organizer shows the actions and embedded skills of Build"></p>

<p>When you build your project or organization, you remain open to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Communicating in a way that makes the goals and processes of your 
project or organization as clear as possible to potential contributors 
and communities of practice.</li>
  <li>Evaluating and adopting the open practices, platforms and tools that will extend and sustain your project’s reach.</li>
  <li>Implementing the most inclusive community-management practices and
 structures you and your contributors devise together to share power and
 decision-making across the project or organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you develop your open leadership practice, you should begin to think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to employ these principles, competencies, and skills in 
increasingly intentional and strategic ways that complement the your

<h2 id="empower">Empower</h2>

<p>These are personal leadership competencies and skills Open Leaders 
use to share capacity, passion, and power within and across projects, 
organizations, communities, and networks. This is how Open Leaders 
manage themselves to spread vision, passion, projects and openness.</p>

<p><img src="olf-empower.png" alt="This organizer shows the actions and embedded skills of Empower"></p>

<p>When you empower others, you remain open to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Addressing your own blind-spots.</li>
  <li>Listening to criticism (even when it’s about you) and growing from it.</li>
  <li>Using feedback (even from failures) to improve the work.</li>
  <li>Balancing competing tensions in a project that drive innovation and progress.</li>
  <li>Sharing and addressing your own vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you develop your open leadership practice, you should begin to think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How your personal leadership style empowers colleagues and 
contributors to realize the benefits of working open through the 
decision-making processes of <strong>design</strong>.</li>
  <li>How your personal leadership skills combine with core open practices from <strong>build</strong> and <strong>design</strong> to inspire people across projects, organizations, networks, communities, and society.</li>
</ul>

<p>Empowering contributors to be open leaders in their own right helps 
ensure the sustainability and maintenance of a project, creates 
opportunities for succession planning in open communities and projects, 
and helps make openness a renewable resource across communities of 
practice.</p>

<p>This framework is a starting place meant to help us better define and
 practice open leadership across Mozilla, the movement for Internet 
health, and society as a whole. It should prompt discussion and inspire 
adaptations, challenges, questions, and improvements.</p>

<p>As we iterate the Open Leadership Framework and curriculum, 
experiences, and assessments informed by it, we’ll look to the Mozilla 
community to let us know what works, what doesn’t work, and what we 
should change.</p>

<p>Please let us know what you think of this framework and how you’re 
using it by contacting Mozilla’s open leadership team. You can email 
project lead <a href="mnailto:chad@mozillafoundation.org">Chad Sansing</a> directly or leave questions, comments, and suggestion on the Google Drive or GitHub versions of this document.</p>

<p>Finally, if you’d like to get a sense of how open leadership looks 
across the Mozilla network or to participate in Mozilla’s open 
leadership programming, please consider the following.</p>

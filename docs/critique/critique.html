    <h4>Assumptions regarding Labor</h4>
    <p>When calculating person-hours, EnCAB assumes that the most efficient
      number of people for a certain task have been employed; for more on
      results and the number of people for a certain task, see Abrams on
      fluctuating labor values (1995).</p>
    <p>One aspect of labor which is not considered in EnCAB is the perspective
      of the workers. For more on this <em>lacunae </em>in energetics studies
      see Bernbeck's article in the Size Matters volume (2019).</p>
    <h4>Why a Critical Note on Sources is Necessary</h4>
    <p>The algorithms used in EnCAB come from a variety of sources which come
      from a wide range of contexts, geographical, chronological and cultural.
      Thus there is an assumption being made about the universality of the data
      behind the algorithms which should be discussed explicitly.</p>
    <p>First, the algorithms are based on the quantification of very specific
      actions -- as such, the assumption of universality is not one tied
      specifically to cultural traits but to physical ability. Clearly genetics
      (and their differences across geography and time) and, indirectly, some
      cultural aspects, play a role in calculating that physical ability.</p>
    <p>Second, the results of the algorithms are given in absolute units, but
      such results can also be used to compare two structures; such a comparison
      means that the numeric result of the algorithms can serve as a basis for a
      relative comparison between the two, leaving aside the actual results
      themselves. As an example, if the mudbricks used to build structure 1
      required 15,000 person-hours, and the mudbricks used to build structure 2
      required 30,000 person-hours, the argument can be made that the energy
      required to make the bricks for structure 2 was double that of structure 1
      since the same algorithm was used to calculate both - and that this result
      holds true even if the precise number of person-hours given by the
      algorithm is called into question.</p>
    <p>Finally, there are three methods by which the universality of the
      algorithms can be tested: source overlap, parallel algorithms and
      calculation of MAD as % of the mean.</p>

    <h4><a>Method 1: Source Overlap<br>
      </a></h4>

    <h4>Method 3: Calculating MAD as % of Mean<br>
    </h4>
    <p>Unbaked mudbrick weight in: Buccellati 2016, 109 (bricks from excavation
      -- 1 m3 weighs 1502 kg) Buccellati 2016, 108 (bricks from experiment -- 1
      m3 weighs 1392 kg)</p>
    <p> Mean absolute deviation: 55 Which is 3.8% of mean </p>

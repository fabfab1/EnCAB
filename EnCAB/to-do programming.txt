CSV data dump from all the input files used (also the ones with errors) with the XML tags as headers. Filename should be "EnCAB_input_xyz.csv" where xyz is the date (year month day format) and time.
 the separator should be a tab character (the error trapping should give an error if there is a tab used in the input, and should replace that character with 4 spaces when sending to the CSV file)

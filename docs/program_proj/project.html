    <h4><a>Project Goals<br>
      </a></h4>
    <p>EnCAB is designed as a digital publication based on a collection of
      algorithms drawn from diverse sources and applicable to construction
      projects in pre-industrial societies. The goal is to provide a single
      resource where algorithms are collected, made available with interactive
      fields, categorized and with a discussion of the categories, and a
      critique of the use of such algorithms.</p>
    <p>As a digital publication, EnCAB is <a href="../cite/cite.html">citeable</a>
      and has its own DOI, and references any information drawn from external
      sources in a complete <a href="../bibliography/bibliography.html">bibliography</a>.
      The HTML pages and algorithms have been written by specific <a href="../authors/authors_index.html">authors</a>,
      to whom credit is given. The algorithms used by EnCAB are drawn from a
      wide variety of sources and chronological contexts, and have been adapted
      to a standard format in order to provide users with interactive fields.
      This adaptation of the algorithms, their classification and descriptions
      as well as their inclusion in <a href="../alg_chains/alg_chains.html">chains</a>
      have all been carried out by the authors mentioned above, and form the
      core of the publication. The interactive algorithms can be used by
      scholars working with the built environment in order to calculate
      energetic and material costs of specific tasks. These algorithms should be
      used with a full understanding of the <a href="../critique/critique.html">possible
        faults</a> in the methodology, and this should be made clear in any
      derivative works.</p>
    <p>EnCAB is of great utility because of its ability to compare diverse
      structures across a wide range of contexts. These comparisons can be
      divided into four categories: ***<br>
    </p>
    <h4><a>What EnCAB is <i>not</i><br>
      </a></h4>
    <p>EnCAB is by no means <u>the</u> way to describe architecture.
      Architecture is an extremely complex and rich resource for scholars
      studying the past, and the study of the effort required in construction is
      merely one way to understand it. Energetics can be of particular use when
      comparing buildings, as the same algorithms can be used to analyze diverse
      buildings and the differences in those answers can lead scholars to
      conclusions about a wide range of cultural aspects.</p>
    <h4><a>Supporting descriptions<br>
      </a></h4>
    <p>While the algorithms build the core of EnCAB, there is a great number of
      descriptive pages linked to the six categories into which the algorithms
      are classified:<br>
    </p>
    <p>The index of <u>material categories</u> can be found <a href="material/material_index.html">here</a>.<br>
      The index of <u>steps in the process</u> can be found <a href="position_in_process/position_in_process_index.html">here</a>.<br>
      The index of <u>source chronology</u> categories can be found <a href="source_chronology/source_chronology_index.html">here</a>.<br>
      The index of <u>source geography</u> can be found <a href="source_geography/source_geography_index.html">here</a>.<br>
      The index of <u>source types</u> can be found <a href="source_type/source_type_index.html">here</a>.<br>
      The index of <u>algorithm types</u> can be found <a href="algorithm_type/algorithm_type_index.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p> In addition to the categories, there are also pages describing the units
      used in the algorithms and a complete bibliography of the publications
      used. </p>
    <p>The index of <u>units used</u> can be found <a href="units/units_index.html">here</a>.<br>
      The <u>bibliography</u> can be found <a href="../bibliography/bibliography.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p>A set of further individual pages give further information on EnCAB, such
      as this page.</p>
    <h4><a>Project -- Algorithms and Pages</a></h4>
    <p>A total of *** algorithms are currently in EnCAB (as of July 1, 2018),
      along with 118 unique HTML files and *** references in the bibliography.</p>
    <h4><a>Project -- Future Plans<br>
      </a></h4>
    <p>While EnCAB, as presented here, is a finished publication (one that will
      hopefully will be expanded by other <a href="../contribute/contribute.html">contributors</a>)
      there is still quite a bit of work to be done; the generation of new
      algorithms to fill gaps in the chains and to create more overlap is
      perhaps the most important. Future research would also include a range of
      case studies showing how algorithms can aid in intra- and inter-cultural
      comparative studies.</p>

List of things still to do in EnCAB Program:

PRIORITY 1
----------
Created by/on field is missing the 'on' portion, which should be taken from <creation_date>. I assume same needs to be done for Modified by/on. Only the author's name would be linked, as you have it now.

source_geography seems to give an error for missing HTML file when it is there.


PRIORITY 2
----------
in the algorithm table, it would be good if the "Al Statement" and "Al Math:" as well as their inputs could be different in the style.css (so a total of 4 styles), so that they can individually be made bold or italics or slightly larger font so as to make them stand out.

The HTML files where the algorithms are placed should have links to anchors for the different categories; example, at the top of 'Algorithms by Material' instead of links to the individual algorithms (Abrans 1994_47_1 etc) there should be links to the materials, so 'earth', 'mudbrick', 'pise'', 'plaster' etc. The same for the algorithm_type.html and the algorithm_position_in_process.html. The algorithm_bibliography.html would instead be by author_year, so Abrams 1994.


PRIORITY 3
----------
create a CSV data dump from all the input files used (also the ones with errors) with the XML tags as headers. Filename should be "EnCAB_input_xyz.csv" where xyz is the date (year month day format) and time. the seperator should be a tab character (the error trapping should give an error if there is a tab used in the input, and should replace that character with 5 spaces when sending to the CSV file)

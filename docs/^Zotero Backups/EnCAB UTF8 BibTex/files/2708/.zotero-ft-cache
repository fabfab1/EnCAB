If your business relies on project management, a client has probably asked you to estimate the man-hours needed to complete a task. A man-hour – or a “person-hour” for a gender-neutral representation – represents the amount of work that can be completed by an average worker in an hour of uninterrupted effort. Calculating man-hours by each type of expert employee used on a project lets you determine the cost of your resources, the value of the contributions made by your experts to the final result, and the estimated time it should take to complete tasks.
Achieving Better Estimates

Calculating man-hours starts off as an observational exercise, especially if you’re a new business owner. It's that the concepts of “average worker” and “uninterrupted effort” mask the reality that different individuals work at different speeds, and it’s difficult to determine when a worker has worked for an uninterrupted hour in order to measure output.

Despite the reality, the basic man-hour calculation is to multiply the number of workers assigned to a task by the total time it takes for them to complete it.
Here's an Example

For example, the owner of a construction company may observe that his team of five electricians took a week to rewire a small building. He estimates the man-hours needed to complete a similar job by assuming each electrician worked eight hours a day over a five-day week. Then he multiplies five electricians by 40 hours in the week to arrive at the estimate of 200 man-hours needed to rewire a small building. The owner may use that estimate to bid on bigger projects, hoping that the time it takes any team of electricians to do work is comparable, even if the project is larger.

As the business completes more projects, the owner can refine the man-hour estimates based on real-world factors, such as individual worker productivity levels over time, ensuring that he never underbids a project based on overestimating the productivity of the company’s workforce.
Man-Hours and Profitability

Once you know the man-hours used to complete a project, you can determine whether the project was profitable. Say in the prior example that the business was paid $10,000 for the crew of electricians to rewire that small building. Dividing $10,000 by 200 man-hours equals $50, meaning each worker was responsible for $50 per hour as a result of the work done.

If the business owner only paid his workers $30 an hour, he has a positive difference of $20 an hour per worker that helps establish the profitability of the project.

The bottom line is the better you are at estimating the man-hours needed to complete a job, the easier it is to ensure what you charge to do a project includes a sustainable profit.

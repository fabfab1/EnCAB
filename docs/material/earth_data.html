<h4><a name="Loam_Earth">Loam vs. Earth</a></h4>
    <p> I have used the word 'earth' as the most generic term; 'loam' would be
      the more correct term in the majority of cases, but 'earth' also includes
      specific types of earthen material used for packing, and would also
      include clay.</p>
